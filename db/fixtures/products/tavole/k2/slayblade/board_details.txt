Winning the triple crown of product awards: Transworld’s Good Wood, Snowboarder’s Best of Test, and Snowboard Mag’s Platinum Pick, there is no question that board design has entered a new phase. Designed in direct response to team demands, the 2010-11 K2 Slayblade snowboard encompasses the very essence of progression, from team favorite FLATLINE Technology with HARSHMELLOW, to the addition of a Ø Sintered Base to make it even lighter, and behold… the new all mountain freestyle king.
