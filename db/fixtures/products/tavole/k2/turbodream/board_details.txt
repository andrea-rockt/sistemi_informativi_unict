Float through anything, spring over chunder, land without impact, ride better than the pros! Sound like a standard snowboard dream? Fortunately Wille Yli-Luoma teamed up with K2 engineers to give you these feelings in your waking hours on the 2010-11 K2 Turbo Dream. ALL TERRAIN ROCKER creates effortless float while the WH3 Core and 4000 Sintered Base combine for faster response and extra air-time. New HARSHMELLOW is added for a smoother more controlled ride. Maybe you won’t be better than Wille…but he’s giving you every advantage he can.
