The Slackcountry UL snowboard features our HighRize™ rocker that provides slightly higher rocker in the front to float above it all and plow through crud, while its twinish shape adds versatility for Riding switch and slashing groomers. Built with the new Hempbrain® top sheet for an ultra light design and eco-friendly flair. With UL techs abound, you’ll float in the pow like you’ve always dreamt, but don’t bother pinching yourself ‘cause this Ride’s for real.
