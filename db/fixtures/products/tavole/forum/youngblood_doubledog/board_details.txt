For the loud and loose. The Youngblood gets juiced up with early release new tech to take the loud and loose crew to a new style. Camber sections under each foot add pop and power, while rocker between the feet and in the nose and tail make the whole thing forgiving and fun. Get weird, make up some new rail tricks, haul ass, crank a ciggie, pop an ollie, have fun. When is someone gonna rock mashup pants with one leg tight and one leg baggy? DoubleDog dare you.
