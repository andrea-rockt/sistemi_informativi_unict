Arc of destruction. Taking top honors by winning the Good Wood Award two years in a row, The Destroyer ChillyDog is built for all-out destruction of the biggest features. The new ChillyDog with Pop has the same forgiving feel of continuous rocker, but with added Pop zones that help load up the nose and tail for even more ollie power. Ollie pop is further amplified by Booter Boosters to make sure you clear every gap, every time.
