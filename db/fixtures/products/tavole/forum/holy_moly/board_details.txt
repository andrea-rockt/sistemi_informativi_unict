You are welcome. The Holy Moly is the best park board in the world. It includes every technology imaginable to make you go higher, faster, jib and land easier. Combo Platter combines the aggressive ollie-pop and control of camber with the forgiving playful feel of rocker, ending the rocker vs. camber discussion forever. With Booter Boosters NexTreme for carbon enhanced ollie-pop, Buttercup in the tip and tail to provide a catch-free ride and the absolute fastest base and lightest wood core possible, the Holy Moly would cost hundreds more if any other brand had the ability to build it. Enjoy. This oneâ€™s on us.
