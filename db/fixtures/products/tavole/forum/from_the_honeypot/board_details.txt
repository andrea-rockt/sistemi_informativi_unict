If you're after getting the honey, then you don't go killing all the bees. This is not only a snowboard – it’s also an idea, a concept, and an experiment. Combo Platter was developed in the Honeypot and has changed how we look at board profiles. Combo Platter takes the benefits of camber and rocker, once thought to be mutually exclusive, and combines them into a powerful and forgiving park machine. Aren’t you glad the spork concept didn’t make it through?
