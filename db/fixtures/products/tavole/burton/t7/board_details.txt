Board Details
The next step for Terje Haakonsen, the NEW T7™ is built upon a legacy of speed, snap, and accelerated airtime. From chasing the high-air mark to freefalling down an Alaskan spine line—the T7 flies faster and higher with the metallic snap of an Alumafly™ Core and cushioned control of Smooth Ride™ internal dampening. Outrun anything—Frostbite Edges join forces with NEW Lightning Bolts Hi-Voltage for grip that won’t slip and energized handling from peak to pipe.
