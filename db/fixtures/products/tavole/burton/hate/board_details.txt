Board Details
It’s the ice and the lift lines, the expensive lodge food and overpriced lift tickets, closed trails, ski school in the park, and lips up to the rails. The Hate embraces it all and focuses the negative energy into raw park power. Rail Ready™ Frostbite Edges heighten grip when you need it yet jib without hang-ups. Flat Kicks combine with V-Rocker™ to terrorize all terrain with float and freedom, while NEW Jumper Cables intensify amplitude, harnessing the aggression within.
