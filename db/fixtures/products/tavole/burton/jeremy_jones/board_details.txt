Board Details
As dynamic as the man himself, Jeremy Jones’ deck is as good in the woods as it is in the hoods. Add NEW Mid Spoon to the equation and you get the crisp pop of Camber with the added looseness of lifted edges between the feet for a catch-free feel that keeps you in control when cranking turns. Rail Ready™ right out of the wrapper, all sizes are also mid wide (including the NEW 154cm) for added float and stability.
