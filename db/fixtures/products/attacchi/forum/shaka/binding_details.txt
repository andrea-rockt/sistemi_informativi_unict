Feel More. Good Vibes. The Shaka improves on the keys to maximum board feel and performance. The Good Vibes Hinge Disk allows the baseplate to flex freely underfoot, which is the only way to take full advantage of Continuous Rocker. The Good Vibes footpad with even more added FGel in the forefoot improves dampening and ensures that only good vibes get through. Customizable freestyle freedom is offered by the Flip Flop strap, which provides adjustable increased medial/lateral support, so you can decide how you feel your strapâ€™s vibes. Winner of multiple on-snow tests and design awards, the Shaka returns as the most progressive freestyle binding available, brah.
