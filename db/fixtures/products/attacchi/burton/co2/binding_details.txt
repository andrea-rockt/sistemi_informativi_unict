NEW Re:Flex™ technology on the CO2™ gives you truer board flex and increased cushioning in a binding that’s compatible with any mounting system, including 4x4, 3D® and the latest generation of The Channel. Removing baseplate material and replacing it with EVA and B3 Gel results in more board feel and cushioning, with 20% less weight. Factor in the new Living Hinge™ Disc and you’ll experience a 71% truer tip-to-tail board flex without sacrificing an ounce of edge-to-edge responsiveness.
