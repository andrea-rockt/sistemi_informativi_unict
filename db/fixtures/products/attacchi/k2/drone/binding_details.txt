This year’s NEW AUTO, the K2 Drone™ snowboard binding, scopes the terrain with high-tech frequency, boasting NEW AUTO-specific toe straps, Litespeed ratchets and Airlock Highbacks. Eliminating unnecessary weight while delivering direct energy transfer and pro-level performance is the Drone’s mantra. Canted HARSHMELLOW shockpads reduce legburn and battle chatter – a surefire combination you’ll appreciate on every lap.
