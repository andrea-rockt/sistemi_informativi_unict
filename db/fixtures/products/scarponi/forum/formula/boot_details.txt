The best park boot possible. A true park boot, the Forumula features Tweaker Technology, which provides a softer medial (inside) flex that not only allows you to style-out your presses, contort your grabs, lock-on that rail, and sneak that last 180, itâ€™s also more comfortable in a wider shred stance. And it still has the support you need to power through a heavy landing. The new removable Feetbelt holds you snug into the Level 4 liner with FGel under your heel for impact cushioning, while the new Footpillow and the Glory Sole with FGel add further underfoot cushioning and dampening. Forever Fit construction keeps the fit consistent without pack-out, no matter how big you go.
