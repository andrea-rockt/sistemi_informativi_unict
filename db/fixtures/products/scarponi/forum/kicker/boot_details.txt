Power to the people. The Kicker is for powerful freestyle riders who charge hard and need a little more support. Maximum cushioning is delivered by the FGel under your heel in the Level 3 liner and in the Good Vibes outsole. This free-flexing outsole moves naturally with the board and binding, allowing you to feel more of the Good Vibes while increasing control for precise high-speed adjustment or just locking into that down-flat-down. And, of course, Forever Fit construction keeps the Kickerâ€™s power until closing day.
