The NEW K2 Ryker™ snowboard boot delivers smooth flex and supportive comfort for 2010-11. The Ryker’s Intuition™ liner and Micro Articulating Cuff combine for unfettered mobility. NEW HARSHMELLOW sole helps cushion hard landings while the NEW CONDA liner system makes for super quick, single-pull internal adjustment and unrivaled heel hold. Crank down the Boa® shell closure for steep chutes or loosen up for extra park ‘shredability.’ Wherever you go, Ryker rules.
