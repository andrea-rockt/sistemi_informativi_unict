The team’s favorite boot gets hopped up. The 2010-11 K2 T1 DB™ (double Boa®) snowboard boots represent unsurpassed quality and performance courtesy of our patented Boa® CONDA lacing system and the external Boa® coiler. K2’s HARSHMELLOW – both inside and out – improves fit and function. A NEW crazy light Vibram® outsole incorporates less glue to shore up the deadly profile and Intuition™ liners bolster a boot that is as durable as it is comfortable.
