Since introducing the “riding shoe” in 1983 we have continuously learned what works and what doesn’t. The NEW Imperial takes all those years, all the hits and highlights, and channels them into the ultimate go-anywhere boot. The grip of a Vibram® outsole meshed with the better board feel of an EST™ midsole; the consistent flex and bulletproof durability of S4 shell paneling and the precise lacing of Speed Zone™—everything that matters is in this boot.
